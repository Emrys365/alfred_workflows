## Alfred workflow: cd

##### Description:

This workflow could help you:
 - open the given path/file in Finder
 - (cmd) reveal the given path/file in Finder
 - (ctrl) open the given path/file in iTerm
 - (shift) copy the selected path to Clipboard

It can remember at most MAX_LENGTH history records that you searched before and you can access them again conveniently.

> MAX_LENGTH is a variable that limits the maximum number of records to remember, and you could modify it as you like in `Workflow Configuration (Environment Variables)`.

> [!TIP]
> Fuzzy search and search for Chinese characters with Pinyin are now supported!

##### Download:

Go [here](https://github.com/Emrys365/alfred_workflows/blob/master/cd.alfredworkflow) and download it directly.

##### Examples:

+ `cd` + nothing : It will list all the history records.

+ `cd` + `path/file name` : It will open the `path` in Finder or open the `file` directly.
