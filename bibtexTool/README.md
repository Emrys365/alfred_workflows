## Alfred workflow: BibTeX tool

##### Description:

This workflow could help you:
 - store new BibTeX entries from the clipboard for later retrieval
 - delete existing BibTeX entries
 - search for any stored BibTeX entry by entering some keywords
 - update existing BibTeX entries with the current clipboard
 - copy any stored BibTeX entry with various formats, including the raw BibTeX string, each separate field, and the rendered reference string
 - count and list all records in the current BibTeX database
 - export the current BibTeX database to a .bib file

It can parse most common BibTeX formats (supported by the BibTeX parser from [here](https://github.com/Emrys365/PlayWithLinux#3-bibtex-parser)) and store each entry in an SQLite database.
The stored BibTeX entries are automatically parsed and normalized with a predefined rule, e.g. the entry names will follow the same naming convention.

  > Note: For the 2nd and 3rd options, if no valid BibTeX entry is found from the clipboard, an error message will be displayed.

+ `bib+` + `any keyword(s)` : It will list all matched BibTeX entries that contain the specified keyword(s) in the selected searching range.

  > Note: The searching algorithm is case-insensitive.
